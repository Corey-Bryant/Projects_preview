# Projects Preview


This repository is public to show some data analysis projects.

Each subfolder in this repository is a different analysis of public data sets. Some folders are large and will take a moment to load.

Within each project code is shown, this is so those who are interested can see how I completed the task. There will be questions and
notations after the "#" symbol above the code. Then you will see the code, followed by the output, or product, of that code. Underneath
tables and figures text will be present providing an explanation, asking another question, or some type of discussion.
